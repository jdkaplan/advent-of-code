I like solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges every year, and these are my solutions.  I've started using this as a way to deepen my understanding of a new programming language every year, so my code isn't likely to be idiomatic or good.  I don't expect this to be useful to anyone, but I'm having fun! :D

- 2015: TODO
- 2016: TODO
- 2017: Python but like a Go programmer
- 2018: Rust
- 2019: Ruby
- 2020: Elixir

Languages I'd like to use for the TODO years:
- WebAssembly
- Haskell
- J (or other APL-like)
