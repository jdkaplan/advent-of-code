I like solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges every year, and these are my solutions. I use this as a way to learn a new language or try new techniques in one I'm already using, so my code isn't likely to be idiomatic or good. I don't expect this to be useful to anyone, but I'm having fun! :D

- 2015: TODO
- 2016: TODO
- 2017: Python
- 2018: Rust (v1.30, 2018 edition)
- 2019: Ruby
- 2020: Elixir
- 2021: Go
- 2022: Rust (Again! v1.65, 2021 edition)

Languages I'd like to use for the future or TODO years:
- J (or other APL-like)
- Haskell
- Zig
- Nim
