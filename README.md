I like solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges every year, and these are my solutions.  I've started using this as a way to deepen my understanding of a new programming language every year, so my code isn't likely to be idiomatic or good.  I don't expect this to be useful to anyone, but I'm having fun! :D
